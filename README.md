# Chess Game

general ToDo list:
  - en passant 
  - reinforcing the dialog
  - checking the endGame method for checkmate, it wasn't working when it should have. 
  - Choice Menu, for player vs player and computer vs player. 
  - refactoring 
  - optimisation : deleting repeating code, using better data Structures etc.
  
 Ai toDo list:
  - Quiescence search (for the horizon problem)
  - Table of pawns (maybe)
  - random popular oppenings
  - timed decisions 
  - memoization of moves already searched.
